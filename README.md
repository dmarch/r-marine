Source code and materials presented in the course "Using R to Work with Marine Spatial Data"

* R-studio with R >= 3.1.0
* R libraries: raster, sp, rgdal, maptools, leaflet, dygraphs, RColorBrewer, rasterVis, rgl, httr, ncdf4, zoo

### Overview
It is recommended to check the [slides](https://github.com/dmarch/r-marine/raw/master/docs/R_marine_presentation.pdf) for each lesson while executing the code. Note that this course has been originally conceived to be conducted presentially. It is assumed that the student is familiar with R and R-studio

It is optional, but highly recommended to create a new project based on this remote Git. Check out this guideline at the [Rstudio website](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) for installing Git on your computer and creating a new project.
